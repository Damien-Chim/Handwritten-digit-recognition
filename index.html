    <h1>Handwritten digit recognition deep learning model</h1>
    <h3>This is a deep learning model that uses artificial neural networks to process and predict human written digits</h3>

    <h2>Try it out!</h2>
    <h3>Write any digits from 0-9 (one at a time) and press the Submit button. Your handwriting will be processed and the model will predict what you wrote</h3>
    <h3>You can experiment with different handwritings, the model should still be able to analyse your handwriting</h3>
    <h3>
        Some tips to obtain the best results:
    </h3>
    
    <li>Try to write as centred as possible in the canvas</li>
    <br>
    <li>Avoid writing near edges</li>
    <br>
    <li>Avoid writing too big or too small, moderate sized handwriting is recommended</li>
